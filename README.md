# Metro-interstate-traffic-volume
Interstate traffic volume in metropolitan areas plays a crucial role in transportation planning and infrastructure development. Understanding the factors affecting traffic volume can help in optimizing transportation systems, reducing congestion, and improving overall efficiency.
The objective of this project is to analyse the metro interstate traffic volume and identify the key factors influencing it. Additionally, a predictive model will be developed to forecast future traffic volume based on these factors.
